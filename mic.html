                There are many affordable microphones in the market today, and they are of decent quality for less critical recording tasks. But when it comes to recording classical music, a higher quality microphone is necessary to capture subtle and elegant qualities that would be lost otherwise. The less expensive microphones such as the Rode NT5 ($400/pair) are often harsh in the high treble and boomy in the low end. The more expensive ones like the Neumann KM184 ($1500/pair) and Schoeps CMC6 MK41 ($3000/pair) are of higher quality but very expensive.

                <p class="long-copy">
                One microphone that I have been longing for is the Neumann KM84, one of the first but often regarded as one of the best small diaphragm condenser microphones ever made.  It has been discontinued and the used ones sold on eBay are often for over $2000 a pair. Fortunately, Neumann has made the circuit of the KM84 open to the public, and by shopping around on the internet, it is possible to make a replica of the KM84 for a very affordable price. No longer under the constraints of profit-driven manufacturers, I had the freedom to pick the highest quality parts while keeping the total cost under $300. I was motivated to challenge myself, and I ended up making a pair of remarkably successful microphones to record an album of my polished piano pieces.

                The internet DIY community commonly uses group buying to lower the cost of parts because it is often not economical to order any custom parts in small quantities. I was able to join a group of 100 people to order a customized small circuit board for this build, as well as mic capsule and its body parts. The total cost comes to about $220 for two mics. Separately, I paid $50 for two output transformers. The electrical components were purchased from Mouser.com, which came to about $20 total. So the final cost for all the materials came to less than $300, not including shipping.

                The first thing to do is to solder the electrical components onto the circuit board. It is a good practice to mark all components to avoid mistakes which are often time-consuming to correct. I used a sheet of paper to sort and mark each component before I started soldering:

                All the small electronics are now soldered onto the board. Next is the XLR connector and it is critical to make sure its orientation is close to perfectly aligned with the circuit board. Solder one connector at first, then adjust the alignment while reheating the solder. Once the position is right, then solder the other two feet.

                Next put on the transformer, and make sure the leads are soldered to the correct pads. The color codes on the circuit board are marked for using a Cinemag CM5722 transformer. If a different transformer is used, then it is the time to check the circuit schematic to make sure the connections are matched(ground to ground, etc). I used a 3U GZT84 transformer so the wiring is different from what marked on the board:

                <p class="long-copy">
                The FET transistor in the circuit provides the main amplification for the input signal. A FET transistor needs a proper DC bias voltage to operate at its designed voltage range without clipping the signal. A trimpot (variable resistor) is used to optimize the load by sending a 1KHz signal to the gate of the transistor and watch the output signal from the mic for minimum distortion.
                <br><br>  
                The procedure for the transistor biasing need to be done with caution, because high 48v phantom power needed to operate the mic circuit. Besides safety caution, an accidental short of the circuit can easily blow up the transistor. Because the gate of the transistor has 46v DC voltage applied, and when it is connected to the signal generator such a high voltage could cause damage to the generator. A 1000pf capacitor is used between the gate and the signal generator to isolate the signal generator from the high DC voltage, in the meantime allow the AC voltage of the 1KHz signal passing through.  
                <br><br>  
                I learned from making the first mic, the trimpot once soldered to the circuit board would be in an awkward position to adjust, and later when I wanted to use a fixed resistor to replace it, the desoldering was very difficult. So when making the second mic, I soldered two wire leads to the trimmer leads first, then soldered the wires to the circuit board as shown in the picture below. This way it is very easy to adjust the trimmer pot and desoldering the wire later from the circuit board is also much easier than desoldering the trimmer pot itself.

                I do not have a dedicated signal generator, so I used my audio interface both as the signal generator and the oscilloscope. I played a 1KHz sine wave (ready downloadable from the internet) in QuickTime player of my Macbook pro in loop mode (do not use iTunes since I found that it will mess up the sine wave) and connected the analog output from my interface to the isolating capacitor shown above. The output from the mic then is connected to the interface and converted back into a digital signal and send to the Adobe Audition software on my computer, from which I can examine the waveform of the resulting signal and do frequency analysis if wanted.

                I first played the sine wave at -10dBu(about 0.25v) and adjusted the waveform to be as symmetric as possible, and gradually worked my way up to +4dBu(1.22v). The wave form showed a slightly flattened bottom before fine-tuning the trimmer pot:
